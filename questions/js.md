    - **Null** type
    - **Undefined** type
    - **Number** type
    - **BigInt** type
    - **String** type
    [is used to represent textual data]
    - **Symbol** type
    [a unique and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an Object property]
- Objects (collections of properties)
