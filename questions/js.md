## Data Types

### What are primitive data types?
- Primitive values (immutable values)
    - **Boolean** type
    [represents a logical entity and can have two values: `true` and `false`]
    - **Null** type
    - **Undefined** type
    - **Number** type
    - **BigInt** type
    - **String** type
    [is used to represent textual data]
    - **Symbol** type
    [a unique and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an Object property]
- Objects (collections of properties, a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value)

### What are the possible ways to create objects in JavaScript?

- with `new` keyword
    ```javascript
    const myCar = new Object();
    myCar.make = 'Ford';
    myCar.model = 'Mustang';
    myCar.year = 1969;
    ```
- using an object initializer
    ```javascript
    const myCar = {
        make: 'Ford',
        model: 'Mustang',
        year: 1969
    };
    ```
### What is undefined property?
- A variable that has not been assigned a value
- has the value undefined.

### What is null value?

- is one of JavaScript's primitive values and is treated as falsy for boolean operations
- has exactly one value: null
- represents the intentional absence of any object value

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/null

### What is the difference between null and undefined?
(beware of the differences between equality (==) and identity (===) operators)
```javascript
typeof null          // "object" (not "null" for legacy reasons)
typeof undefined     // "undefined"
null === undefined   // false
null  == undefined   // true
null === null        // true
null  == null        // true
!null                // true
isNaN(1 + null)      // false
isNaN(1 + undefined) // true
```

### What is the difference between window and document?

- **window**

    The `Window` interface represents a window containing a DOM document; the `document` property points to the DOM document loaded in that window.

    `document.defaultView` returns the window object associated with a document, or `null` if none is available

    `window.document` returns a reference to the document contained in the window

    A global variable, `window`, representing the window in which the script is running, is exposed to JavaScript code.

    In a tabbed browser, each tab is represented by its own `Window` object; the global `window` seen by JavaScript code running within a given tab always represents the tab in which the code is running.

    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window


    `window` is the execution context and global object for that context's JavaScript.
    
    Each browser tab has its own top-level `window` object.

    Each `<iframe>` element has its own `window` object too, nested within a parent window.

    Each of these windows gets its own separate global object. `window.parent` and `window.top` might refer to enclosing windows, giving access to other execution contexts.

    `window` properties include: `setTimeout()`, `setInterval()` -- binding event handlers to a timer; `location` -- giving the current URL; `history` (w/ back(), `forward()` methods), `navigator`.

    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9895202/what-is-the-difference-between-window-screen-and-document-in-javascript#answer-41927247

- **document**

    The `Document` interface represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web page's content, which is the DOM tree.

    It provides functionality globally to the document, like how to obtain the page's URL and create new elements in the document.

    The `Document` interface describes the common properties (`Document.contentType`,`Document.fonts`, `Document.links`, `Document.activeELement`, `Document.body`, `Document.children`, ), methods (`Document.createElement()`, `Document.createEvent()`, `Document.getElementById()`, `Document.querySelector()`) and events (`scroll`, `animationend`, `drag`, `keydown`, `readystatechange`, `touchstart`, `pointerenter`) for any kind of document. Depending on the document's type (e.g. HTML, XML, SVG, …), a larger API is available: HTML documents, served with the `"text/html"` content type, also implement the `HTMLDocument` interface (`Document.location`, `Document.Title`, `Document.ReadyState`), whereas XML and SVG documents implement the `XMLDocument` interface.

### What are global variables?

### What is NaN property?
NaN - a value representing Not-A-Number, typically encountered when the result of an arithmetic operation cannot be expressed as a number
- If NaN is involved in any mathematical operation, the result is also NaN.
- When NaN is one of the operands of any relational comparison (>, <, >=, <=), the result is always false.
- NaN compares unequal (via ==, !=, ===, and !==) to any other value — including to another NaN value.
- NaN is also one of the falsy values in JavaScript.
