## Data Types

### What are primitive data types?
- Primitive values (immutable values)
    - **Boolean** type
    [represents a logical entity and can have two values: `true` and `false`]
    - **Null** type
    - **Undefined** type
    - **Number** type
    - **BigInt** type
    - **String** type
    [is used to represent textual data]
    - **Symbol** type
    [a unique and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an Object property]
- Objects (collections of properties, a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value)

### What are the possible ways to create objects in JavaScript?

- with `new` keyword
    ```javascript
    const myCar = new Object();
    myCar.make = 'Ford';
    myCar.model = 'Mustang';
    myCar.year = 1969;
    ```
- using an object initializer
    ```javascript
    const myCar = {
        make: 'Ford',
        model: 'Mustang',
        year: 1969
    };
    ```
### What is undefined property?
- A variable that has not been assigned a value
- has the value undefined.

### What is null value?

- is one of JavaScript's primitive values and is treated as falsy for boolean operations
- has exactly one value: null
- represents the intentional absence of any object value

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/null

### What is the difference between null and undefined?
(beware of the differences between equality (==) and identity (===) operators)
```javascript
typeof null          // "object" (not "null" for legacy reasons)
typeof undefined     // "undefined"
null === undefined   // false
null  == undefined   // true
null === null        // true
null  == null        // true
!null                // true
isNaN(1 + null)      // false
isNaN(1 + undefined) // true
```
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/null#difference_between_null_and_undefined

### What is the difference between window and document?

- **window**

    The `Window` interface represents a window containing a DOM document; the `document` property points to the DOM document loaded in that window.

    `document.defaultView` returns the window object associated with a document, or `null` if none is available

    `window.document` returns a reference to the document contained in the window

    A global variable, `window`, representing the window in which the script is running, is exposed to JavaScript code.

    In a tabbed browser, each tab is represented by its own `Window` object; the global `window` seen by JavaScript code running within a given tab always represents the tab in which the code is running.

    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window


    `window` is the execution context and global object for that context's JavaScript.

    Each browser tab has its own top-level `window` object.

    Each `<iframe>` element has its own `window` object too, nested within a parent window.

    Each of these windows gets its own separate global object. `window.parent` and `window.top` might refer to enclosing windows, giving access to other execution contexts.

    `window` properties include: `setTimeout()`, `setInterval()` -- binding event handlers to a timer; `location` -- giving the current URL; `history` (w/ `back()`, `forward()` methods); `navigator`, etc.

    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9895202/what-is-the-difference-between-window-screen-and-document-in-javascript#answer-41927247

- **document**

    The `Document` interface represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web page's content, which is the DOM tree.

    It provides functionality globally to the document, like how to obtain the page's URL and create new elements in the document.

    The `Document` interface describes the common
    
    properties (`Document.contentType`, `Document.fonts`, `Document.links`, `Document.activeELement`, `Document.body`, `Document.children`),

    methods (`Document.createElement()`, `Document.createEvent()`, `Document.getElementById()`, `Document.querySelector()`) and

    events (`scroll`, `animationend`, `drag`, `keydown`, `readystatechange`, `touchstart`, `pointerenter`) for any kind of document.

    Depending on the document's type (e.g. HTML, XML, SVG, …), a larger API is available: HTML documents, served with the `"text/html"` content type, also implement the `HTMLDocument` interface (w/ eg. `Document.location`, `Document.Title`, `Document.ReadyState`), whereas XML and SVG documents implement the `XMLDocument` interface.


### What is isNaN?

The `isNaN()` function determines whether a value is `NaN` or not.

(it is not possible to use the equality operators (== and ===) to compare a value against `NaN` to determine whether the value is `NaN` or not, because both `NaN == NaN` and `NaN === NaN` evaluate to `false`)
The `isNaN()` function provides equality check against NaN.

If `isNaN(x)` returns `false`, you can use `x` in an arithmetic expression not making the expression return `NaN`.

```javascript
isNaN(NaN);       // true
isNaN(undefined); // true
isNaN({});        // true

isNaN(true);      // false
isNaN(null);      // false
isNaN(37);        // false

// strings
isNaN('37');      // false: "37" is converted to the number 37 which is not NaN
isNaN("37,5");    // true
isNaN('blabla');   // true: "blabla" is converted to a number. Parsing this as a number fails and returns NaN
isNaN('123ABC');  // true:  parseInt("123ABC") is 123 but Number("123ABC") is NaN
isNaN('');        // false: the empty string is converted to 0 which is not NaN
isNaN(' ');       // false: a string with spaces is converted to 0 which is not NaN

// dates
isNaN(new Date());                // false
isNaN(new Date().toString());     // true
```
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/isNaN

### What is the difference between let, const and var?

`let`, `const` & `var` are variable declarations

`let` and `const` declarations are scoped to the block statement that they are declared in. variables created with `var` are not block-scoped, but only local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within

temporal dead zone apply to both `let` and `const`

- **let**

    The `let` declaration declares a block-scoped local variable

    allows you to declare variables that are limited to the scope of a block statement, or expression on which it is used, unlike the `var` keyword, which declares a variable globally, or locally to an entire function.
    
    The other difference between `var` and `let` is that the latter is initialized to a value only when a parser evaluates it

    A `let` or `const` variable is said to be in a *"temporal dead zone" (TDZ)* from the start of the block until code execution reaches the line where *the variable is declared and initialized with a value*.
    This differs from `var` variables, which will return a value of `undefined` if they are accessed before they are declared.
    ```javascript
    { // TDZ starts at beginning of scope
      console.log(bar); // undefined
      console.log(foo); // ReferenceError
      var bar = 1;
      let foo = 2; // End of TDZ (for foo)
    }
    ```

    Just like `const` the `let` does not create properties of the `window` object when declared globally (in the top-most scope):
    ```javascript
    var x = 'global';
    let y = 'global';
    console.log(this.x); // "global"
    console.log(this.y); // undefined
    ```
    Many issues with `let` variables can be avoided by declaring them at the top of the scope in which they are used

    Redeclaring the same variable within the same function or block scope raises a `SyntaxError`.
    ```javascript
    if (x) {
      let foo;
      let foo; // SyntaxError thrown.
    }
    ```

- **const**

    Constants are block-scoped, like `let` variable declarations. The value of a `const` can't be changed through reassignment (i.e. by using the assignment operator `=`), and it can't be redeclared, creates a read-only reference to a value. However, if a constant is an object or array its properties or items can be updated or removed.

    An initializer for a constant is required. You must specify its value in the same declaration.

    Global constants do not become properties of the `window` object, unlike `var` variables.

    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const

- **var**

    `var` declarations, wherever they occur, are processed before any code is executed. This is called hoisting. It's initial value is `undefined`.

    Only a variable's declaration is hoisted, not its initialization. The initialization happens only when the assignment statement is reached. Until then the variable remains undefined (but declared):

    ```javascript
    'use strict';

    function do_something() {
        console.log(bar); // undefined (note: not ReferenceError)
        var bar = 111; // the initialization w/ the assignment statement
        console.log(bar); // 111
    }

    // the code above is interpreted as:
    function do_something() {
        var bar; // the declaration happened and it is hoisted
        console.log(bar);
        bar = 111;
        console.log(bar);
    }
    ```

    The scope of a variable declared with `var` is its current execution context and closures thereof, which is either the enclosing function and functions declared within it, or, for variables declared outside any function, global.

### What are the differences between undeclared and undefined variables?

- **Undefined**: when a variable has been declared but has not been assigned with any value.
    ```javascript
    var a;
    console.log(a)  // undefined
    ```

- **Undeclared**: when we try to access any variable that is not initialized or declared earlier using `let`, `const` or `var` keyword.
    ```javascript
    console.log(myVariable) //ReferenceError: myVariable is not defined
    ```

### What are global variables?
When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a *global variable*, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a *local variable*, because it is available only within that function.
(the global scope is the scope that contains, and is visible in all other scopes)

### What are the problems with global variables?
- **Variable naming collisions** - If you're working on a team and both yourself and your co-worker use the same variable name on the global scope, the variable defined last will overwrite the initial variable.

- **Security** - Specifically on the web, every user has access to the Window (or global) object. By putting variables on the global scope, you give any user the ability to see or change your variables.

3) **Performance** - This is almost negligible, but it still exists. The way JavaScript variable lookups work is the JavaScript engine will do a lookup on the current scope the variable is being looked up in. If it can't find it, it will do a look up on the next parent scope. If it doesn't find it there, it will continue looking upward until it reaches the global object looking for that variable. If all of your variables are located on the global scope, the JavaScript engine will always have to go through every scope in order to finally reach the global scope to find the variable.

### What is NaN property?
NaN - a value representing Not-A-Number, typically encountered when the result of an arithmetic operation cannot be expressed as a number
- If NaN is involved in any mathematical operation, the result is also NaN.
- When NaN is one of the operands of any relational comparison (>, <, >=, <=), the result is always false.
- NaN compares unequal (via ==, !=, ===, and !==) to any other value — including to another NaN value.
- NaN is also one of the falsy values in JavaScript.

### What are classes in ES6?
Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data.

the class syntax has two components: class expressions and class declarations

- **class declaration**

     One way to define a class, using the `class` keyword with the name of the class

     classes must be defined before they can be constructed

     ```javascript
    const p = new Rectangle(); // ReferenceError

    class Rectangle {}
     ```

- **class expression**
    another way to define a class. Class expressions can be named or unnamed
    ```javascript
    // unnamed
    let Rectangle = class {
        constructor(height, width) {
            this.height = height;
            this.width = width;
        }
    };
    ```
    ```javascript
    // named
    Rectangle = class Rectangle2 {
        constructor(height, width) {
            this.height = height;
            this.width = width;
        }
    };
    ```

    The body of a class is the part that is in curly brackets `{}` in which you define class members, such as methods or constructor

### How do you check whether a string contains a substring?

```javascript
includes(searchString)
includes(searchString, position) // optional - the position within the string at which to begin searching for searchString. (Defaults to 0.)
```

```javascript
const sentence = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.';

const word = 'fox';

console.log(`The word "${word}" ${sentence.includes(word) ? 'is' : 'is not'} in the sentence`); // "The word "fox" is in the sentence"
```

### How do you check if a key exists in an object?
```javascript
const example = {
    prop: 'exists'
};

example.hasOwnProperty('prop'); // returns true if the specified property is a direct (not inherited) property of the object (does not check in the object's prototype chain)
'prop' in example; // returns true if the specified property is in the specified object or its prototype chain

example.prop !== undefined
example['prop'] !== undefined
```


### How do you copy properties from one object to other?

```javascript
Object.assign(target, ...sources)
```

```javascript
const target = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const source = { b: 4, c: 5 };

const returnedTarget = Object.assign(target, source);

console.log(target); // Object { a: 1, b: 4, c: 5 }
console.log(returnedTarget === target); // true

const target2 = {...target, ...source}
console.log(target2); // Object { a: 1, b: 4, c: 5 }

for (let key in source) {
    target[key] = source[key]
}
```

### What is a proxy object?

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy

### What is the main difference between Object.values and Object.entries method?

`Object.values()` method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property values

`Object.entries()` method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property [key, value] pairs.

```javascript
const object1 = {
  a: 'somestring',
  b: 42,
  c: false
};

console.log(Object.values(object1)); // Array ["somestring", 42, false]

console.log(Object.entries(object1)); // [ ['a', 'somestring'], ['b', 42], ['c', false] ]
```

### How can you get the list of keys of any object?

```javascript
Object.keys(obj) // returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names
```

```javascript
const object1 = {
  a: 'somestring',
  b: 42,
  c: false
};

console.log(Object.keys(object1)); // Array ["a", "b", "c"]
```

### How do you create an object with prototype?
The `Object.create()` method creates a new object, using an existing object as the prototype of the newly created object.

```javascript
const person = {
  isHuman: false,
  printIntroduction: function() {
    console.log(`My name is ${this.name}. Am I human? ${this.isHuman}`);
  }
};

const me = Object.create(person);

me.name = 'Matthew'; // "name" is a property set on "me", but not on "person"
me.isHuman = true; // inherited properties can be overwritten

me.printIntroduction(); // "My name is Matthew. Am I human? true"
```

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create

### What is a WeakSet?

`WeakSet` objects are collections of objects (only!). Just as with Sets, each object in a `WeakSet` may occur only once; all objects in a `WeakSet`'s collection are unique.

```javascript
const ws = new WeakSet();
const foo = {};
const bar = {};

ws.add(foo);
ws.add(bar);

ws.has(foo);    // true
ws.has(bar);    // true

ws.delete(foo); // removes foo from the set
ws.has(foo);    // false, foo has been removed
ws.has(bar);    // true, bar is retained
```

### What are the differences between WeakSet and Set?

`Set` objects are collections of values. You can iterate through the elements of a set in insertion order. A value in the `Set` may only occur once; it is unique in the `Set`'s collection.

a `Set` is like an array that can only contain unique values but we can still iterate through it like an array using methods like for loops and `.forEach`.

Similar to a `Set`, `WeakSet` is a collection of objects that are unique from each other but differs because `WeakSet` can only store objects and cannot contain arbitrary values of any type like strings or numbers.

`WeakSet`s use weak references

`WeakSet` is not enumerable. This means there is no way to loop over the items contained within it because there is no list of current objects stored in the collection


    If you need to store additional data temporarily and don’t want to worry about cleaning up the memory or how the objects are removed, then use weak references

https://blog.logrocket.com/weakmap-weakset-understanding-javascript-weak-references/

### What is a WeakMap?

The `Map` object holds key-value pairs and remembers the original insertion order of the keys. Any value (both objects and primitive values) may be used as either a key or a value.

`Map` is like an object where we can store key-value pairs and access the values contained within the `Map` through the key. Unlike a standard object in JavaScript, we must use the `.get()` method to access the values.

In comparison to a `Map`, a `WeakMap` is very much the same but the references it holds are weak references, meaning it won’t prevent garbage collection from removing values it references if they are not strongly referenced elsewhere.

`WeakMap` is not enumerable due to the weak references.

we must use objects as the keys, but the values can be any arbitrary value like a string or number.

```javascript
const wm1 = new WeakMap();
const wm2 = new WeakMap();

const obj1 = {};
const obj2 = window;

wm1.set(obj1, 100);
wm1.set(obj2, 'Hello');
wm2.set(obj1, obj2); // You can set the value to be anything including an object or function
wm2.set(obj2, undefined); // Or, undefined
wm1.set(wm2, wm1); // Or, even a WeakMap itself

wm1.get(obj1); // 100

wm1.has(obj1); // true
wm1.delete(obj1);
wm1.has(obj1); // false
```

    If you need to store additional data temporarily and don’t want to worry about cleaning up the memory or how the objects are removed, then use weak references
