## HTML

### What is Critical Rendering Path?
### What is the DOM? How does the DOM work?

The **Document Object Model (DOM)** is the *data representation of the objects* that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web.

The DOM is a *programming interface for web documents*. It *represents the page / document* *as nodes and objects* (it's an object-oriented representation) so that, programming languages (like JavaScript) can interact with the page / they can manipulate it.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction

### Explain the difference between layout, painting and compositing?

https://web.dev/rendering-performance/

The CSSOM and DOM trees (based on the HTML and CSS input) are combined into a **render tree**, which is then used to compute the layout of each visible element and serves as an input to the paint process that renders the pixels to screen.

1. The DOM (all visible DOM content) and CSSOM (style information) trees are combined to form the *render tree*. Render tree contains only the nodes required to render the page.
2. *Layout* computes the exact position and size of each object within the viewport -- aka. *Reflow* => *"box model"*
3. The last step is *paint*, which takes in the final render tree and renders the pixels to the screen.

    ~ the process of filling in pixels. It involves drawing out every visual part of the elements. The drawing is typically done onto multiple surfaces, often called *layers*.

4. *Compositing*. Since the parts of the page were drawn into potentially multiple layers they need to be drawn to the screen in the correct order so that the page renders correctly. This is especially important for elements that overlap another.


60 Hz = 60fps *framereate*

1. HTTP Get req
2. *Parse HTML* - get all the nodes => DOM
3. DOM + CSS - *Recalculate styles*
4. *Render tree* - no `<head>`, `<script>`s, `display: none;`-ed elements but also *pseudo elements*
5. *Layout* ~ *Reflow* how much space elements take up & where they are on screen
6. *Paint* - vector to raster
   1. creating a list of `draw` calls (`drawRectangle`, `drawText`) & *Image decode + Resize*
   2. filling in pixels
7. Composite layers - put the individual layers (painted parts of the page) together, involves *layer management* (the right layers are in the correct order) [load all the above from CPU to GPU]

1. a visual change via JS / CSS animations / Web Animation API
2. Style
3. [Layout / Reflow] - not happens eg. on background change
4. [Paint] - eg. `opacity` & `transform` only triggers composite
5. Composite

v

- Stick to `transform`s and `opacity` changes for animations (handled by compositor only)
- Promote moving elements with `will-change` or `translateZ`.
  
  ```css
  .moving-element {
    will-change: transform;
    // or
    transform: translateZ(0);
  }
  ```
- Avoid overusing promotion rules; layers require memory and management.

### What does async and defer refer in script tag? Describe the difference between `<script>`, `<script async>` and `<script defer>`

When the browser loads HTML and comes across a `<script>...</script>` tag or `<script src="..."></script>` external script, it can’t continue building the DOM. It must execute the script right now / must wait for the script to download, execute the downloaded script, and only then can it process the rest of the page.

In practice, `defer` is used for scripts that need the whole DOM and/or their relative execution order is important.
And `async` is used for independent scripts, like counters or ads. And their relative execution order does not matter.

- **defer**

  `defer` attribute tells the browser not to wait for the script. Instead, the browser will continue to process the HTML, build DOM. The script loads “in the background”, and then runs when the DOM is fully built.

  - never block the page
  - always execute when the DOM is ready (but before `DOMContentLoaded` event)
  - *Document order* - Deferred scripts keep their relative order (like regular scripts). [Browsers scan the page for scripts and download them in parallel; `defer` attribute ensures that the relative order is kept. So even though `small.js` loads first, it still waits and runs after `long.js` executes]
  - is ignored if the `<script>` tag has no src -- only works for external scripts

- **async**

    - also makes the script non-blocking -- loads in the background
    - *Load-first order* - The DOM and other scripts don’t wait for them, and they don’t wait for anything. A fully independent script that runs when loaded.
    - like `defer`, the `async` attribute is ignored if the `<script>` tag has no src -- is only for external scripts
